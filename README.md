# secure-med-data-transfer

Our project focuses on developing a robust solution for secure medical data transfer in the healthcare industry. We recognize the importance of securely transferring medical data to protect patient privacy and enable effective collaboration among healthcare professionals. To address this need, we propose a cyber-physical system framework that leverages blockchain technology.
 
By utilizing blockchain, we create a decentralized and tamper-resistant ecosystem for storing and sharing medical data. Both patients and doctors are represented as blocks within the blockchain, ensuring transparency and traceability of all interactions. To enhance security, we integrate blockchain principles with the RSA asymmetric algorithm, establishing a trust-based environment that safeguards sensitive medical information.
 
Our system empowers patients by allowing them to selectively share their medical data with authorized doctors using the doctors' public keys. This ensures that only the intended recipients have access to the patient's confidential records. Patients retain full control over their data and can revoke access privileges at any time, minimizing the risk of unauthorized disclosure.
 
To ensure secure data transfer, we employ the RSA asymmetric algorithm, which utilizes a pair of keys for encryption and decryption. This cryptographic algorithm provides confidentiality and integrity for the transferred data, making it highly challenging for adversaries to gain unauthorized access to medical records.
 
Additionally, our project addresses the issue of data storage by adopting the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) as the underlying storage infrastructure. IPFS employs a decentralized and distributed approach, storing data in the form of hash values. This approach ensures data redundancy, availability, and resilience to failures or attacks, guaranteeing that medical records remain accessible and intact even in unforeseen circumstances.
 
In summary, our project aims to revolutionize the handling and sharing of medical data by leveraging blockchain, RSA asymmetric encryption, and IPFS storage. By creating a secure and transparent ecosystem, we strive to enhance patient privacy, streamline collaboration among healthcare professionals, and ultimately improve the overall quality of healthcare services
